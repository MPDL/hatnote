# Visualization

An audiovisualisation of the Max Planck Digital Library services (minervamessenger, keeper, bloxberg). Events of these
services are presented as fading dots accompanied by a relaxing soundscape. Dot sizes and tone pitches vary based on event
information. Based on [Hatnote](https://github.com/hatnote/listen-to-wikipedia).
