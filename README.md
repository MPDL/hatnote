# Visualization

An audiovisualisation of the Max Planck Digital Library services (minervamessenger, keeper, bloxberg). Events of these
services are presented as fading dots accompanied by a relaxing soundscape. Dot sizes and tone pitches vary based on event
information. Based on [Hatnote](https://github.com/hatnote/listen-to-wikipedia).

## Build

For development run `npm run build-dev`. Staging: `npm run build-staging`. Production: `npm run build-prod`.

Then run `npm run start` to start the web server.

Now you can open the website on http://localhost:3000.
